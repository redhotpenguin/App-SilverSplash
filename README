NAME
    App::SilverSplash - A network captive portal for Linux platforms.

ABSTRACT
    See http://groups.google.com/group/silversplash for information. This
    module is currently beta status and being polished.

DESCRIPTION
    Silver Splash is a captive portal for Linux platforms.

    Setup is still rough - see the Google Group for discussion of setup.

    But there are a few notes being added here.

    You will need to add the apache user to /etc/sudoers and give it
    permission to run iptables. Here's the entry I'm using:

     apache  ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/iptables

    Adding apache to iptables worked quite well, however I also had to
    comment out # Defaults requiretty
